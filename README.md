# simple-request-caching [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tobiaslabs/simple-request-caching.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tobiaslabs/simple-request-caching)

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/saibotsivad/simple-request-caching.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A very simple caching approach for requests.

## install

There are no external dependencies for the code, so feel free to copy+paste it into whatever framework
you are using (e.g., [here's an Angular example](https://gist.github.com/saibotsivad/84d8faf3c8351c89ea3b)).
Otherwise, install using:

```sh
npm install simple-request-caching
```

## using

The basic setup is this:

```js
var CachedRequest = require('simple-request-caching')

var request = new CachedRequest({
	cacheMillis: 500, // the millis that the request is cached, or -1 for forever
	request: function(params) {
		return http.get('/url/path', params)
	}
})
```

Set a single one of those up for any request you want to cache, then use it like:

```js
request({ key: 'value' }).then(function(data) {
	// the response from the http.get(), as a promise
})
```

## api

When you make a new `CachedRequest`, it has the following parameters:

* `cacheMillis` (required): The number of milliseconds to cache the request
	response. Use `-1` to cache things forever.
* `request` (required): The function called when a request is not cached. Must
	return a promise. Rejected promises are not cached.
* `stringify` (optional): A function that is called to stringify the request
	parameters. If unspecified, a default is used which will stringify flat
	object correctly and efficiently. If you have deeper objects, you'll want
	to implement your own `stringify` function.
